# Image_Classification

In this assignment you will implement codes to perform the function of different stages of an image classification pipeline based on different classifiers. The following objectives are expected to be achieved with this assignment:

- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.

## We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset for this assignment which can be downloaded from <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>

1: Implement a  k-Nearest Neighbor classifier on the given dataset(30 points)

2: Write code to training a Support Vector Machine classifier(35 points)

3: Write your own custom code to implement a Softmax classifier(35 points)

4: Write a custom function to implement a  Two-Layer Neural Network (50 points)
